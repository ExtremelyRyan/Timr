## Another time tracker CLI?

Having to submit a timecard for my daily work activites, I wanted to make a little tool that would do the annyoying
time conversions for me (because I kept forgetting the name of the website that does it).

Then I thought, why not, why not write my own little task tracker while I am at it?
