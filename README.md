## Another time tracker CLI?

Having to submit a timecard for my daily work activites, I wanted to make a little tool 
that would do the annyoying time conversions for me 
(because I kept forgetting the name of the website that does it).

Then I thought:

## TODO

 - most of the app

 - [x] timecard calculator
 - [ ] read / writing tasks to a file.
 - [ ] range based task lookup
 - [ ] name based task lookup

 - incorperating a [TUI](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui/blob/main/examples/README.md#user-input) would be a very interesting premise once I get the actual thing working.
