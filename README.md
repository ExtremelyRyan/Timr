# Timr (WORK IN PROGESS)
A handy timecard calculator plus command line application to keep track of time spent on tasks 

## Another time tracker CLI?

Having to submit a timecard for my daily work activites, I wanted to make a little tool 
that would do the annyoying time conversions for me 
(because I kept forgetting the name of the website that does it).

Then I thought:

so I am.
